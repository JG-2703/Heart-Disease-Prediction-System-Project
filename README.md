## 🚀 Features

- **Prediction Models**: Displays results from multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, etc.).
- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - ROC curves and AUC scores.
  - Confusion matrices.
  - Model accuracy comparison graphs.
  - Feature correlation heatmaps.
  - Age distribution histograms.
  - Target class bar charts.
- **Dynamic Results**: All model predictions and performance metrics displayed on a single page.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and responsive design for smooth navigation.
